    "\n",
    "Centennial to millennial quasi-periodic oscillations appear in all manner of well-dated Holocene paleoclimate records. Though the origin of this variability is debated, the similarity between the periods recovered from the spectral analysis of Holocene paleoclimate records and corresponding reconstructions of total solar irradiance (TSI) has led to the hypothesis that TSI variations drive Holocene climate cycles (the \"solar hypothesis\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the use of [the `Pyleoclim` software package](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to estimate the spectra from Holocene temperature records and estimate whether they exhibit significant periodicities in the 800-3000 year band.\n",

    "  <strong>Note:</strong> This notebook was created with the help of an artificial intelligent (AI) assistant for paleoclimatology (PaleoPAL) that it currently (November 2025) under active development. Code and conclusions were reviewed by a human. Prompts to the AI are written in the markdown cells (preceded by @agent) and kept for transparency. Correction to the code is marked. The additional lines of code generated by PaleoPAL but not needed in the context of this notebook are commented out.\n",
